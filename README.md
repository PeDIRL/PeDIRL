yo, i'm pedirl, aka maya. uhh, i first created a github acc after using it for a whiiiiiile as just a normal user (mostly for switch cfw purposes) because i started theodinproject. i never got too far in it, but i *am* currently using it quite a bit for some stuff relating to personal projects and shit. i'm learning quite a bit of stuff by just Doing™ which is nice, and i'll prolly end up learning more than through TOP like this. i do want to thank TOP for the help it gave me with getting started with shit because i Would Not be able to do what i'm doing rn without doing the like. half of foundations i did in TOP lol it's a pretty nice site and i still check back on it sometimes for reference. aaaanyways p much nothing here currently is anything a random person coming here would be able to understand so uh. you can just ignore it.
oh yeah my pronouns are she/her
and lastly i have a [rentry](https://rentry.co/pedirl) although i might change it in favor of a github page i dunno. ty for reading and allat
